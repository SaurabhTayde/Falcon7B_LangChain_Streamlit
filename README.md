# Falcon7B_LangChain_Streamlit

Created a simple Bot which provides answer on user's questions.
(No API of any LLM has been used in this process. I have installed/downloaded  open source LLM 'Falcon-7B' on Google colab Pro and utlized it's colab's  for processing)

This bot is built using following:
1. Falcon 7B LLM
2. LangChain Framework
3. Streamlit for deployment
4. Google colab Pro for GPU usage

This GitHub repository showcases the development of an LLM (Large Language Model) application using an open souce LLM 'Falcon 7B' model, the LangChain framework, Streamlit for deployment, and Google Colab Pro as the platform.

The application leverages the power of the Falcon 7 Billion parameter model to generate decent quality responses.
The LangChain framework provides the necessary tools and interfaces to seamlessly integrate the LLM with external data sources and APIs. (Utilized 'LLMChain' package here).
Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface for the application, allowing users to interact with the LLM and obtain insightful responses.
