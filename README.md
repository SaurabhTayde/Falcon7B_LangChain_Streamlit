# Falcon7B_LangChain_Streamlit

Created a simple Bot which provides answer on user's questions. (Please note, I have kept token limit as 600).
This GitHub repository showcases the development of an LLM (Large Language Model) application using the Falcon 7 Billion parameter model, the LangChain framework, Streamlit for deployment, and Google Colab Pro as the platform.
The application leverages the power of the Falcon 7 Billion parameter model to generate decent quality responses.
The LangChain framework provides the necessary tools and interfaces to seamlessly integrate the LLM with external data sources and APIs. (Utilized 'LLMChain' package here).
Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface for the application, allowing users to interact with the LLM and obtain insightful responses.
